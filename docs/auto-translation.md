The auto-translations module includes automatic translations, flag translations and manual message translations.

## 1. Auto-translation

Automatically replaces messages in foreign languages with a translated version in the form of a webhook.

?> Auto-translation currently only supports English. Use flag translation for other languages.

## 2. Flag translation

React to a message with a flag to translate it to that language. Lucie will only respond if it supports the language and can find a translation.

In case you find an unsupported language, please report it in our [Support server](https://lucie.gg/server).

## 3. Manual translation

In case auto-translation didn't work, you can manually translate a message by doing the following:

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:PC -->
1. Right-click on the message.
2. Hover over "Apps" and select Translate.

<!-- tab:Mobile -->
1. Hold down on the message.
2. Tap "Apps" and then "Translate".

<!-- tabs:end -->

?> Manual translation currently only supports English. Use flag translation for other languages.
