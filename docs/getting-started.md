## Navigating

Each of Lucie's modules have their own page which can be found in the sidebar.

Every module page contains the commands associated with that module. Below commands you can find the options, a description, examples and other information.

### Command options

The options are formatted in a bullet list of the name of each option and its description. A required option is indicated with an asterisk (*).

If an option has specific values to choose from, they will be formatted in an indented bullet list under the option they're associated with.

If an option has a default, minimum or maximum value or an example, it will be formatted between brackets (()).

### Sub-commands

Sub-commands are also formatted in a bullet list but are prefixed with a slash (/).

## Configuration

To see all of Lucie's modules, use **/module list**. Individual modules can be enabled/disabled by using **/module enable** and **/module disable**. To get a list of all commands you can use, use **/help**.

?> **/help** will return a different list of commands depending on the current context (a server or DMs). It might not show you all of Lucie's available commands.
