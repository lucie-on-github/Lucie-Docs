## "Application didn't respond" and "Lucie is thinking..."

If you see this message, it means Lucie has either run into an uncaught error or crashed. If you see this, please notify us about it in our [support server](https://lucie.gg/server) so we can quickly resolve the issue!

## Is Lucie free?

Lucie is mostly free, but some features are locked behind Lucie Premium. Check the [website](https://lucie.gg/premium) for more information.

## I've set up an automation but Lucie isn't doing anything

If you've set up auto-roles, reaction-roles or other automatic actions, make sure Lucie has the correct permissions to perform this action. If Lucie needs to send messages in a channel, make sure it has access to that channel. If Lucie needs to give members certain roles, make sure Lucie has permission to manage roles and has a role that's higher than the members' highest roles.

## There is missing/wrong information in this documentation.

Writing documentation and mainting a bot takes time. So it's normal that this documentation is a bit behind on Lucie's features. We do our best to try and keep this documentation as up-to-date as possible but we're mere humans. Feel free to help us by contributing to this documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucie-on-github/Lucie-Docs).

## Lucie's messages contain obscure content

Are you seeing something like :Checkmark: or :Cross:? This means Lucie is missing the permission to use external emojis. Check your channel and role settings to make sure Lucie has this permission.

Are you seeing "undefined"? This is an error. Please report it in our [support server](https://lucie.gg/server).
