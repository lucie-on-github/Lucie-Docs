### /russianroulette
Play Russian Roulette. Russian Roulette is a game where you spin the barrel of a gun with 6 chambers, making it impossible to know in which chamber the bullet is and giving it a chance of 1 in 6 to be in the first chamber. After spinning the barrel, Lucie will virtually (without any harm) hold the gun against your head and pull the trigger. If the bullet was in the first chamber, you will die (timed out for 15 minutes), if not, you will survive and be free.

:::note
This game won't work if you're the server owner or Lucie doesn't have permission to time you out.
