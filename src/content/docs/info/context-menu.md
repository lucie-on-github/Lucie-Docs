Context menu commands are commands that can be activated via the context menu.

## How to open the context menu

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:PC -->
1. Right-click on a message or user.
2. Hover over "Apps" and select.

<!-- tab:Mobile -->
1. Hold down on the message or user.
2. Tap "Apps".

<!-- tabs:end -->

This will open a list of available context menu commands. Unless there aren't any, then you won't see the "Apps" option. The list will show the bot's avatar as well as the name of each command.

From this list, you can select a command to use it.
